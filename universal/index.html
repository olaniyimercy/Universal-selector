    <h2>PSALM 23</h2>
    <p>
      1. The lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. 2. He makes me lie down in
      green pastures; he lead me beside still waters. 3. He restore my soul; he
      lead me in the paths of righteousness for his name sake 4. Yea, though I
      walk the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for you are
      with me; your rod and staff guide me 5. You prepare a table before me in
      the presence oy my enemies; you anointed my head with oil; my cup runneth
      over 6. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life;
      and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever. AMEN
